# Variables : is a name that refers to a value
# we wirte it like this ===> Variable = value
# Variable types ( int - string - float - boolean - list - tuple - dictionary )

# assignment variable
x = 5     # Intger
y = 4.5   # Float

# Multi assignment

# you can use ; if you want to code in one line

print(type (x)) ; print(type(y)) ; print(type (a)) ; print(type(b))

# Operators
# Arithmatic operators like ====>
#( + << Addition , - << Subtraction ,* << Multiplication , / << Division )

# Comparison operators
# ( < less than ,  > greater than  , == equal to , != not equal )
# ( <=  less than or equal , >= greater than or equal )


# Assignment operators
# ( +=  , -=  , *=  , **=  , /=  )
